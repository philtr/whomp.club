# Eternal Dodgewhomp

## Supplies

- 5 Whomps
- 5 Dodgeballs

A whomp is a pool noodle cut in half.

For dodgeballs, we use Little Tikes Mini Foam Soccer Balls. We buy them at Toys R Us for about $6 each. I have not found a good source for them online. They are 4.7" diameter coated foam, and they are perfect for dodgeball.

## Setup

One of the great things about this game is that it can be played just about anywhere with minimal setup. If you have a multi-use auditorium/gym, it actually works better to leave the chairs in place. Alternatively, stack the chairs but leave them scattered about. It's up to you! Different setups will give the game a slightly different flavor.

Scatter whomps and dodgeballs around the playing area relatively evenly.

### 2. Optional Rules

These rules are completely optional, but add a twist or new element to the game that provide different advantages for different types of players

#### 2.1 Golden Whomp

- **2.1.1** elect one whomp of a different color (preferably in the yellow spectrum) to be the "Golden Whomp"
- **2.1.2** The player who picks this whomp up may continue to use it until they are out
  - Watch out! This person usually become a target for everyone else since they wield so much power.

#### 2.2 Golden Ball

- **2.2.1** Similar to the the golden whomp rules, select one ball of a different color to be the "Golden Ball"
- **2.2.2** The player who picks this ball up does not have to remain in place and may move freely within the play area.

#### 2.3 Lightning Round

- **2.3.1** If you are limited on time, once you reach two minutes before the desired end time, call "Lightning round", and everyone who is out goes back in.
- **2.3.2** All the rules are the same, except one a player is out, there is no getting back in.

#### 2.4 Team Play

Many times, alliances and teams form naturally during gameplay. My students haven't enjoyed these official team play rules as much as the individual rules.

- **2.4.1** Rules are the same, but when only one team is left in play, the game is over.
