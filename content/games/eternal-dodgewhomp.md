# Eternal Dodgewhomp

## Supplies

- 5 Whomps
- 5 Dodgeballs

A whomp is a pool noodle cut in half.

For dodgeballs, we recommend Little Tikes Mini Foam Soccer Balls (4.7" diameter coated foam), which can typically be found at toy retailers for approximately $6 each. [Rhino dodgeballs](https://smile.amazon.com/Champion-Sports-Bounce-Dodgeball-6-Inch/dp/B000LXYKNO/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1492889204&sr=1-1&keywords=rhino%2Bball&th=1&psc=1) are an alternative option, though at a higher price point.

## Setup

This game requires minimal setup and can be played in various environments. In multi-use auditorium/gym spaces, chairs may be left in place or stacked and scattered throughout the area to create obstacles and varied gameplay dynamics.

Distribute whomps and dodgeballs evenly throughout the playing area.

### 2. Optional Rules

These rules are optional variants that add strategic elements and provide advantages for different play styles:

#### 2.1 Golden Whomp

- **2.1.1** Select one whomp of a different color (preferably yellow or gold) to be the "Golden Whomp"
- **2.1.2** The player who possesses this whomp may continue to use it repeatedly until they are eliminated
  - Note: This player typically becomes a primary target due to their enhanced capabilities

#### 2.2 Golden Ball

- **2.2.1** Similar to the Golden Whomp rules, select one ball of a different color to be the "Golden Ball"
- **2.2.2** The player who possesses this ball is not required to remain stationary and may move freely within the play area

#### 2.3 Lightning Round

- **2.3.1** When time is limited, call "Lightning Round" two minutes before the desired end time. All eliminated players immediately re-enter the game.
- **2.3.2** All standard rules apply, except there is no re-entry after elimination during the Lightning Round.

#### 2.4 Team Play

While alliances and teams often form naturally during gameplay, these official team play rules can be implemented as an alternative format:

- **2.4.1** All standard rules apply, but the game ends when only one team remains in play.
